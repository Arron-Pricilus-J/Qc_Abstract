QUANTUM COMPUTING AND ITS POTENTIAL IN SCIENCES - A REVIEW

 
    ABSTRACT
          Quantum computing is used by computers that are data storage 
 and computing machines that make advantage of quantum physics characteristics. The
 quantum computers that are currently available are small, noisy prototypes, but the field is rapidly progressing. 
 The biggest advantage of using quantum computing is its ability to solve problems in multidimensional spaces which
 super computers may be incapable of. This aspect is looked upon to work on the technological advancements in the
 field of science. The potential of quantum computers effectively explores thousands of combinations in parallel and
 discards those that do not work. This opens up the possibility of reducing the time, financial, and labour costs
 associated with developing new methodologies such as new discoveries in quantum-drug design, quantum-cryptography,
 quantum-based security systems and so on. In this review, quantum computing is introduced along with the various 
 scientific applications. This work also puts forth the way forward of quantum computing in the respective sciences.
